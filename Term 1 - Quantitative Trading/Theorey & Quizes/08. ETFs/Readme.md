# Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)

## Short-commings of Mutual Funds

### Drawbacks of Open-ended Mutual Funds
1. An open-ended mutual funds may need to maintain parts of their assets under management (AUM) in cash to let investors withdraw their shares on any given day. This dilutes the fund's overall performance.
2. Open-ended mutual fund limits the number of times you can invest/withdraw within a time frame.
3. Fund share price is determined when the market closes.

### Drawbacks of Close-ended Mutual Funds

Close-ended mutual funds tried to overcome the above problems by making their shares tradable in stock market. But market-value of these shares may diverge from the fund's portfolio.

## ETFs

ETFs, like mutual funds, allows us to invest in portfolio of stocks. They are tradable on stock-exchange like stocks. Market price of ETF closely follows the value of underlying portfolio.

## How ETFs are used in Trading
* ETFs make it easier to invest in commodities and international stocks.
* ETFs are also used for hedging (we’ll see how a bit later).
* Commodities are raw materials that are interchangeable and tradable. Commodities include energy, precious metals, and agriculture.

## Commodity Futures
* Futures contract are standardized agreements between two parties to trade an asset at a future date, at a predetermined price.
  * The participant who agrees to buy is “long” the future.
  * The participant who agrees to sell is “short” the future.
* If you entered into a futures contract and wish to cancel, or “close” your position, you may do so by entering into an opposing position in the same asset, at the same due date.
* A *forward contract* is a specific agreement between two parties that isn’t standardized for other buyers or sellers. Since forward contracts are tailored specifically by the two counterparties, they’re not tradable like futures contracts. 
  * Forward contracts are also referred to as “bespoke”, which is just another word for “custom made” or “tailor made”.
  
## Commodity ETFs
* Investors who wish to gain exposure to commodities may buy futures contracts, but this requires them to *roll over* their positions regularly. 
  * *Rolling over* a futures contracts involves closing out the existing position before its due date and then taking a new position that is due at a later date. 
* Commodity ETFs handle this, so investors could more easily buy and hold shares in a commodity ETF and not worry about rolling over individual futures contracts.

## International ETFs
* If investors wish to trade international stocks, these stocks would be listed on a stock exchange of another country, and may be in a different time zone. 
* This means that trading is done during the stock exchange’s open hours, which may not be as convenient for the investor.
* International ETFs are traded on a local stock exchange, while they are still linked to the stocks that are listed abroad

## Hedging with ETFs
* Hedge funds use ETFs for hedging purposes. They may construct a portfolio that optimizes their exposure to certain stocks that they believe will perform well, and in order to cancel out general market movements, they may also short an ETF that contains a similar set of stocks. 
* They may also short sector-specific ETFs if they wish to have a neutral exposure to those sectors.

## ETF Sponsors
* ETF Sponsors are the financial institutions that issue ETFs. 
* We can think of them as most similar to the fund managers of mutual funds, because they design a portfolio and issue ETF shares. 
* ETF Sponsors may generally charge lower fees compared to other types of funds, in part because of some efficiencies that make it cheaper to run the fund.

## Authorized Participants
Authorized Participants (APs) and ETF Sponsors partner together to make the ETF system work. We can think of APs as the intermediaries between investors and the ETF Sponsor. Unlike mutual funds or hedge funds, ETF Sponsors don’t take cash to invest, nor do they deal directly with investors. ETF Sponsors take a portfolio of stocks instead of cash, and they trade with APs instead of with investors. ETF Sponsors and APs create ETF shares with the “create process”.<br><br>

The “create process” involves the following steps:<br>

1. The Authorized Participant buys stocks and bundles them in the same proportions as defined by the ETF Sponsor.
2. The AP gives these stocks to the ETF Sponsor.
3. The ETF Sponsor creates ETF shares and gives these to the AP.
4. The AP sells the ETF shares to investors.

## Redeem Process
When individual investors wish to divest their holdings in an ETF, they can sell their shares to other investors on the stock exchange, like they would with a stock. This is the same process for investors of closed end mutual funds.<br>

To exchange ETF shares for their underlying stocks, this requires what’s called the “redeem process”, and is a transaction between ETF Sponsor and APs. The redeem process takes ETF shares out of circulation, and puts the underlying stocks back into the market.<br>

The redeem process involves the following steps:<br>

1. The AP buys ETF shares from investors in the stock market.
2. The AP trades these ETF shares with the ETF Sponsor in exchange for the original stocks.
3. The AP sells these stocks on the stock exchange.

 ## Arbitrage
 
Arbitrage is the act of simultaneously buying and selling assets that are interchangeable, in order to profit from pricing differences. Arbitrage plays a role in making markets more efficient, which means that prices are more consistent for the same asset. When investors and funds collectively find and act on arbitrage opportunities, they reduce price discrepancies in the market.

## Misaligned ETF prices and Arbitrage Opportunity
* The market value of an ETF share may diverge from the market value of its underlying portfolio of stocks (its NAV).
* If an ETF share price is higher than its NAV, we say it’s trading at a premium.
* If an ETF share price is lower than its NAV, we say it’s trading at a discount.
* The difference between the ETF share price and its NAV can be called its “basis”.
