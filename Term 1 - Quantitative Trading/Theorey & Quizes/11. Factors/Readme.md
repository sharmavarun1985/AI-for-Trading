# Factors

## Overview
Factors are a list of numerical values, one for each stock, potentially predictive of an aspect of the performance of these stocks in the future. Below figure shows an example of factor-<br>

Here, we are assigning larger weights to the company that has greater return and lower weights to the company with lower returns.

## Standardizing Factors

The below 2 figures show how to standardize a factor and the coresponding example.<br>

## Why do we need to standardize factors?

* We need to standardize factors in order to make the portfolio *dollar neutral*.

* Dollar Neutral implies a portfolio has *dollar amount of long positions equals dollar amount of short positions.*
* If a portfolio is *dollar neutral,* then it is less influenced by overall market movement as shown in the figure below.

* *Notional* : A portfolio's notional is the number we can multiply the stock weights by in order to get a dollar value for each stock's position. When all the positions add up to 0, it is called *dollar neutral*.<br>

## Leverage

Leverage is the act of borrowing in order to invest. Borrowing cash in order to go long on more positions may magnify gains but also losses.<br><br>

## Leverage Ratio
* The leverage ratio is the sum of the magnitudes of all positions, divided by the notional. 
* The leverage ratio gives a sense of how much risk a portfolio is taking, because taking more positions magnifies both gains and losses. 
* To standardize a factor, we divide by the sum of the magnitudes (sum of the absolute value of the positions), so that this rescaled vector's sum of magnitudes is equal to one. 
* This makes different factors more comparable, because it's as if you're comparing different portfolios but each with the same amount of money placed on their positions.

## Zipline Pipeline
Zipline is a Pythonic algorithmic trading library. It is an event-driven system for backtesting. Zipline is currently used in production as the backtesting and live-trading engine powering Quantopian â€“ a free, community-centered, hosted platform for building and executing trading strategies. <br>
Notebook for using zipline can be found [here](https://github.com/purvasingh96/AI-for-Trading/blob/master/Term%201/Theorey%20%26%20Quizes/11.%20Factors/Quizzes/3.%20zipline_coding_exercises.ipynb)
